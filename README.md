# Repository Archived

This repository has been archived in favor of the `v1.0.0` release of the original project, where multi-user support is now possible.

## Why the Archive?

The decision to archive this repository was made to streamline development efforts and avoid fragmentation. With the release of v1.0.0 of the original project, multi-user support has been implemented, rendering the need for this separate repository obsolete.

## Where to Go Next

To take advantage of the latest features, including multi-user support, we encourage you to visit the official repository of the original project. You can find it at https://github.com/n4ze3m/dialoqbase
